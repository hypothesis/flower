# By default when you Ctrl-c the `make dev` command tox is too aggressive about
# killing supervisor. tox kills supervisor before supervisor has had time to
# stop or kill its child processes, resulting in detached child processes being
# left running and other problems.
#
# Fix this by configuring tox to wait a long time before sending any further
# SIGINTs (after the first one) or SIGTERMs or SIGKILLs to supervisor.
# Just trust supervisor to clean up all its child processes and stop.
